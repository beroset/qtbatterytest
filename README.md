# qtbatterytest

This code is intended to read the battery level of a Bluetooth-connected AsteroidOS watch using Qt version 6.

At the moment, it always returns 0 which is not correct.  It's not yet determined where the problem lies; this 
code is intended as a small test to assist with troubleshooting.  See https://github.com/AsteroidOS/libasteroid/issues/13
